Question: Is there a particular airport(s) we can blame for flight delays, as in\
it causes frequent delays which propagates to later flights in the day?\ 
\
This question is worth answering for airlines so they can figure out which\
airport(s) is the bottleneck in their network and may be able to better schedule\
around it.\
\
Hypothesis: I hypothesize a handful of airports are to blame for the majority of\
delays. If an airport is large but not large enough that any airlines use it as\
a hub, there aren't many spare airplanes the airlines can use in case something\
goes wrong, which would cause delays leading to further delays. Also, every time\
I use San Jose (SJC) my flight seems to be delayed by at least 30 min. so I want\
to verify if I am just being unlucky.\

On this website, I had to download data by month, and one month of data was about\
200-250MB, so if I use about 6-7 yrs of data, it would be 15GB.
